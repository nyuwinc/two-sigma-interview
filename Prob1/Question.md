# Problem 1, Question
### Q: Create an algorithm to determine whether a string has unique characters
#### Example:
```
isUnique("hello") => false
\\ This returns false since since 'l' is used twice in the string

isUnique("pie") => true
\\ This returns true since every word in "pie" is only used once
```
