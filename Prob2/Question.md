# Problem 2, Question
### Q: Two strings are considered anagrams of each other if the words in one string can be used to form a different string. Create an algorithm to determine if two strings are anagrams of each other. They do not need to be valid words.

Example:
```
isAnagram("book", "okbo") => true
// Even if "okbo" doesn't mean anything in English, you can still use the words from "book" to form "okbo"
// You can also use the words from "okbo" to form "book"

isAnagram("apple", "attic") => false
// You can't use the words from "apple" to form "attic", and you can't use the words from "attic" to form "apple"
```
